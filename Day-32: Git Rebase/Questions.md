Git Rebase: What It Is, Why It’s Useful, and How to Do It
When collaborating on a project, developers often create branches to work on specific features while the main branch (master or main) continues to receive updates from other teammates. Eventually, the feature branch needs to be synchronized with the latest changes in the main branch.

There are two ways to achieve this: merging and rebasing.

What is Rebase?
Rebase is a way of updating your feature branch with the latest changes from the main branch, but without creating an extra merge commit. Instead, Git takes your feature commits and “replays” them on top of the current main branch.
Why Use Rebase?
Cleaner history – avoids unnecessary merge commits, making the project timeline easier to read.
Easier debugging – linear history helps when using tools like git log or git bisect.
Keeps commits grouped – your feature work is neatly stacked on top of the latest main branch.
Better collaboration – rebased branches are often simpler to review in code reviews.
⚠️ Note: Rebasing rewrites history. Do not rebase branches that are already shared with others unless your team agrees to it.
