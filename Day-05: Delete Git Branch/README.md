# Nautilus Project - Git Branch Cleanup

## Overview
This document outlines the process for cleaning up test branches in the Nautilus project repository located on the Storage server in Stratos DC.

## Project Details
- **Project**: Nautilus News Application
- **Repository Location**: `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/news`
- **Server**: Storage Server (Stratos DC)
- **Task**: Delete test branch created during development

## Branch Information
- **Branch Name**: `xfusioncorp_news`
- **Status**: Test branch requiring cleanup
- **Action**: Delete from local repository

## Requirements
- Access to the Storage server in Stratos DC
- Git installed on the system
- Appropriate permissions to modify the repository
- Not currently checked out on the branch to be deleted

## Task Description
During active development and testing phases, several test branches were created in the repository. The DevOps team has been tasked with cleaning up these branches to maintain repository hygiene and prevent confusion among developers.

The specific requirement is to delete the `xfusioncorp_news` branch from the Git repository located at `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/news`.

## Pre-requisites
1. SSH/Terminal access to the Storage server
2. Git version control system installed
3. Permission to delete branches in the repository

## Important Notes
- Ensure you are not currently on the branch you wish to delete
- If the branch contains unmerged changes, a force delete (`-D`) may be required
- Always verify the branch list before and after deletion
- If the branch exists on a remote repository, additional steps may be needed

## Verification
After completing the deletion task, verify that:
1. The branch no longer appears in the local branch list
2. The repository remains in a stable state
3. Other branches are unaffected

## Support
For issues or questions regarding this task, contact the DevOps team or refer to the command.md file for detailed step-by-step instructions.
